# Concept

**Application (with GUI – desktop game)**
- The project consists of a 2D pixel-art desktop game, designed with a graphical user interface. Player controls a cat character that runs through an obstacle-filled environment and jumps to avoid these obstacles to earn points. The game focuses on reflexes, timing and increasing difficulty to keep players engaged.

**Use case collection**
- The primary users are casual players, children or young adults, who enjoy short, skill-based games with simple controls and increasing difficulty. 
- Users interact with the game whenever they choose to play, typically in short, repeatable sessions. The game is designed for quick entertainment rather than continuous long-term use.
- Players interact with the system using keyboard controls (for example pressing arrows or spacebar to make the cat jump).
- The interface of the game consists of:
    -	Main menu (start, restart, exit options)
    -	Game screen (cat, background and score)
    -	Game-over screen (final score, restart option, exit option)
- The system runs on desktop computers or laptops. It is developed to be playable on most modern operating systems that support Python.

Here you should explain:
- The type of product developed with that project, for example (non-exhaustive):
    - Application (with GUI, be it mobile, web, or desktop)
    - Command-line application (CLI could be used by humans or scripts)
    - Library
    - Web-service(s)
    - Data processing toolkit (= Library + CLI, or Jupyter Notebook)

- Use case collection
    - Where are the users?
    - When and how frequently do they interact with the system?
    - How do they interact with the system? Which devices are they using?
    - Does the system need to store user's data? Which data? Where?
    - Most likely, there will be multiple roles.
